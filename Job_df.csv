Who are we looking for?
We are seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher - Microbial Bioinformatics to join School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health, Academic Division.
Microorganisms have a profound influence on biological, environmental, and industrial processes, but understanding the complex dynamics of microbial communities and how to manipulate them to our advantage remains a challenge. CMR Director Professor Gene Tyson has recently been awarded a prestigious ARC Laureate Fellowship that aims to overcome current technological limitations and transform microbial ecology from a descriptive to a predictive science. This will be achieved using as a model the most intensively studied ecosystem on the planet: the human gut microbiome. The Fellowship program will deliver new tools for integrated meta-omic analysis, a biobank featuring thousands of novel microorganisms from the human gut, and machine learning models to predict how entire microbial communities will respond to changes in their environment. The successful candidate will join this exciting project to lead the development of a new bioinformatic pipeline for the integrated analysis of meta-omic data. The role will also involve building new machine learning models to assign putative functions to the hundreds of proteins from the human gut microbiome that currently lack known functions.

307,https://www.seek.com.au/job/71309116?type=standout&ref=search-standalone,Queensland University of Technology (QUT),Brisbane QLD,Research & Fellowships (Education & Training),Full time,"$32,000 pa for three years, indexed annually","The Centre for Microbiome Research (CMR) within the School of Biomedical Sciences at QUT is looking for talented individuals to undertake PhDs applying cutting-edge laboratory and bioinformatic approaches to the study of complex microbial communities across a range of topics and environments. International applicants are welcome.Three PhD positions are available supervised by Professor Gene Tyson and Dr Simon McIlroy. 1. Improving human health through the microbiome Each individual harbours a unique collection of microorganisms—the majority of which reside in the gastrointestinal tract—that influences nearly every aspect of human health. As such, the gut microbiome is emerging as a potential tool for the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of diseases. However, microbiome studies yield vast amounts of data, and the complexity of the microbiome makes it difficult to decipher interactions between microorganisms, host cells and environmental factors. This project will integrate high-throughput metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metabolomic techniques with advanced machine learning approaches to address this challenge, providing a comprehensive view of the microbial role in a range of human diseases. Complementing these approaches, genome-based microscopy will be used to improve our understanding of complex host-microbe interactions. This holistic approach will help identify new disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and drive us closer to unlocking the potential of microbiome research in human health. 2. Metabolic diversity of the anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea mediating methane oxidation in freshwater environmentsThe as-yet uncultured archaeal lineage Methanoperedenaceae are anaerobic methanotrophs with a key role in mitigating the atmospheric release of methane in freshwater environments. The metabolic diversity of these microorganisms directly links methane with several key biochemical cycles and suggests a remarkable ability of these microorganisms to adapt to diverse environmental conditions. The overall aim of this PhD project will be to uncover the metabolic diversity of the Methanoperedenaceae and to understand the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for these adaptations. The project will utilise cutting-edge meta-omic and single cell visualisation techniques. 3. Understanding microbial responses to climate change Permafrost thaw induced by climate change will make up to 174 Pg of near-surface carbon available for microbial degradation and emission as CO2 and CH4. This project will aim to improve prediction of these processes through genome-centric meta-omic analysis of microbial communities in northern Sweden, where a decade of intense molecular and biogeochemical study has been undertaken. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to examine how microbial communities are changing alongside our climate. The overall aim of this project is to examine how individual microbial community members and entire communities assemble, adapt and acclimatise to changing environmental conditions. About the projects and scholarshipsThe projects will be based at the Centre for Microbiome Research (CMR) located at the Translational Research Institute (TRI) in Woolloongabba, Brisbane. CMR was established in 2020 by Professor Tyson, an expert in the field of bioinformatics and microbial ecology. Professor Tyson and his team are actively involved in the development of innovative culture-independent molecular approaches and bioinformatic tools, and their application to answer important questions about microbial communities across a range of ecosystems. The team is made up of researchers with diverse expertise within microbial ecology and genomics, providing an intellectually robust and collaborative environment. As part of CMR the successful student will have access to state-of-the-art computing and laboratory facilities.A living allowance stipend, tax exempt and indexed annually $32,000 per annum for a period of three years is available, with a top up of $2,000 per annum for outstanding applicants. In addition to the living allowance stipend, the successful applicant will receive student allocation funding of up to $6,000 towards ancillary project costs such as conference travel. International students will receive a full tuition fee sponsorship.EligibilityYou must have:• recently completed a BSc Hons degree or equivalent in a relevant field (bioinformatics, microbiology, genomics or biochemistry)• received first-class honours (H1) or equivalent• excellent communication skills, motivation and the ability to work as part of a team• a general interest in microbiology and ideally you will also have experience with bioinformatics.You must also meet the academic eligibility requirement as set out in the QUT How to Apply website: QUT - How to apply.How to applySubmit your expression of interest to Dr Simon McIlroy at [email protected]Your application must include:• a cover letter indicating which project(s) you are most interested in• an up-do-date CV • full academic transcript• a summary (up to two pages) of your research career to date• details of three referees (email/address/contact number).Application closing dateOpen until filledMore informationPlease contact Dr Simon McIlroy at [email protected] for further information.",Manager Sustainability

This will be achieved using as a model the most intensively studied ecosystem on the planet: the human gut microbiome. The Fellowship program will deliver new tools for integrated meta-omic analysis, a biobank featuring thousands of novel microorganisms from the human gut, and machine learning models to predict how entire microbial communities will respond to changes in their environment.
The successful candidate will join this exciting project to lead the development of a new bioinformatic pipeline for the integrated analysis of meta-omic data. The role will also involve building new machine learning models to assign putative functions to the hundreds of proteins from the human gut microbiome that currently lack known functions.
